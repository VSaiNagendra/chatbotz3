	Dear Sir/Madam,  I checked my Payslip for the month of November 2018 and found that my salary is not as per agreed and signed appointment letter. My BASIC salary had to be Rs.83642 and you have paid Rs.76672. All other figures of Conveyance, HRA, Medical Reimbursement, Special Allowance are also wrong. Please check and rectify and pay the difference. Also Even after sending all relevant documents to you, I find no detail is uploaded like PAN Card No, Bank details, my photo, etc....    Please rectify and reply at your earliest.    Regards,  B S Javalagi          This e-mail (including any attachments) may contain confidential and/or privileged information.

	Hello,    This is with regards to the PF Withdrawal application i initiated on  25-11-2018. Yesterday i got a message states that my application has been  rejected because associate is currently employed in other organisation as  per UAN. I would like to reiterate that my last employment was on *17th  July 2018.* Currently i am not employed anywhere. As per the PF withdrawal  guidelines i am eligible to withdraw my pension after 90 days.  The other issue i found that there is a mismatch in my PF NO in Salary slip  when compare to the PF Statement this could be a reason to reject my  application. Below are the PF Account Number mentioned as follows  * Salary Slip* : BG/BNG/0035244/000/1081816   *PF Satement* : BG/BNG/0035224/000/1081816   *APPLICATION FORM TOWARDS PROVIDENT FUND SETTLEMENT :  *BG/BNG/0035244/000/1081816  ( The application downloaded from TL Connect after filling up the Online  application - This PF Number matches with the salary slip but not with the  PF Number in PF Statement)   UAN Number :100171703244.
